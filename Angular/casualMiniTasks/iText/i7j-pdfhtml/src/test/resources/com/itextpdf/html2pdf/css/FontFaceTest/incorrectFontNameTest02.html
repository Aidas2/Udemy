		<p>This test passes if next line says F</p>
		<p class="test">F</p>
		<p>The previous line says FAIL. However we consider it to be correct.
			Although the font-family specified by the paragraph's class doesn't match the one of fontface,
		font's full name contains specified font-family and iText takes it into account.</p>
		<p>UPD: That is not relevant anymore. The line shall say F as in browsers and that's considered to be correct behavior.</p>
